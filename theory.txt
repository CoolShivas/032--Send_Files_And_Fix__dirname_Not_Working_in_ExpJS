Starting of ExpressJS step by step.

Step :- 1.) Formation of package.json file using npm init command in the terminal.

Step :- 2.) Installation of express using npm install express or npm i express command in the terminal.

Step :- 3.) Creation of .gitIgnore file to make sure that node_modules package will not push it to gitHub repo.

Step :- 4.) Creation of new blank file named as app.js. And, also make sure that the package.json file should also have this ("main": "app.js") instead of this ("main": "index.js" ). Actually, it's depends on us whatever name we want to give. Give it but mention it on the package.json file's key&value as this ("main": "app.js") or anything else.

Step :- 5.)  Use of ES module by which we can use import and export feature instead of require.

Step :- 6.) Automatically, ExpressJS understand itself most of the things such as (Request Method GET; Status Code 200 OK;content-type text/html; charset=utf-8; and multi-line code). Previously, we have to defined this things in NodeJS.
