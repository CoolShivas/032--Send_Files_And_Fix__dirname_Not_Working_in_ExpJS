Starting of ExpressJS step by step.

Step :- 1.) Formation of package.json file using npm init command in the terminal.

Step :- 2.) Installation of express using npm install express or npm i express command in the terminal.

Step :- 3.) Creation of .gitIgnore file to make sure that node_modules package will not push it to gitHub repo.

Step :- 4.) Creation of new blank file named as app.js. And, also make sure that the package.json file should also have this ("main": "app.js") instead of this ("main": "index.js" ). Actually, it's depends on us whatever name we want to give. Give it but mention it on the package.json file's key&value as this ("main": "app.js") or anything else.

Step :- 5.)  Use of ES module by which we can use import and export feature instead of require.

Step :- 6.) Automatically, ExpressJS understand itself most of the things such as (Request Method GET; Status Code 200 OK;content-type text/html; charset=utf-8; and multi-line code). Previously, we have to defined this things in NodeJS.

Step :- 7.) Use of .env file to hide sensitive information or data from others. So, firstly create the .env file and mention about the (PORT=4000) in the root directory of project. Secondly, open the app.js and instead of (const PORT = 3000;) use this (const PORT = process.env.PORT;). Thirdly, open the package.json file and mention about the dev such as ("shiva": "node --env-file=.env --watch app.js"). And, finally don't forgot to add this (.env in the .gitIgnore file)  run the project again.
